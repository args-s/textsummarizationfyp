BODY. Twitter has 'permanently suspended' US President Donald Trump's account due to the risk of further incitement of violence, the social media company said.
"After close review of recent Tweets from the@realDonaldTrump account and the context around them we have permanently suspended the account due to the risk of further incitement of violence," the company said in a tweet.
On Wednesday, Twitter temporarily blocked Mr Trump's account, which had more than 88 million followers, following the siege of Capitol Hill by pro-Trump protesters.
A police officer later died of injuries sustained during the riot.
Twitter had warned that additional violations by the US president's accounts would result in a permanent suspension.
The White House did not immediately comment.
Facebook said earlier this week it was suspending Donald Trump's account through until at least the end of his presidential term.
Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said an initial 24-hour ban was extended because of Mr Trump's "use of our platform to incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government".
He is due to hand over to President-elect Joe Biden on 20 January.
Last night, President Trump said he would not attend the inauguration of his Democratic successor, just hours after promising a peaceful transition of power.
"To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the inauguration on January 20th," Mr Trump wrote on Twitter, before his account was suspended.
