# Text Summariser

# Introduction
This project is the result of a final project created by Killian using existing
graph technology created by Diarmuid O'Donoghue.

The aim of this project is to create a system which can reliably create
human-like summaries of pieces of text. My aim is to utilise both Extractive
and Abstractive method of summarisation.
